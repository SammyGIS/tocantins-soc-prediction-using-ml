## Soil Organic Carbon Prediction using Machine Learning (Regression Problem)
### Overview
In this comprehensive analysis, we aim to predict soil organic data using three distinct machine learning models. 

The selected models are:
1. **Random Forest Regressor**
2. **Linear Regression**
3. **Support Vector Regression**

#### Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis include:

- Implementing three diverse machine learning models to predict soil organic data.
- Evaluating the performance of each model to identify the most effective predictive approach.
- Selecting the best predictive model based on thorough assessments.

#### Model Evaluation Parameters
The performance of each model will be assessed using the following evaluation parameters:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** A measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Represents the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Feature Importance:** The importance of various features will be assessed using OLS.
- **Area Under the Curve (AUC):**  The Area Under the Curve (AUC) will be calculated to assess the overall performance of the models.

#### Relationship Measurement
- OLS will be employed to measure the relationship between the data.
- Correlation Analysis will be used to measure the relationship
